            <h2 class="write">my name is YALAMANCHI VYSHNAVI,i'm from visakhapatnam, i've completed my graduation from gitam university with a 
                cgpa 7.2. i've completed a course from nxtwave as a full stack developer, from these course i  
                have learned a lot and developed my skills through practical experience. technologies i 
                learnt are html, css, javascript, python, reactjs, nodejs and sql. i also had a hands-on experience
                on these technologies( as i built many projects with these technologies). 
                recently, i have successfully completed my training on web development provided by nullclass 
                where i learnt how to build a real time website like stackoverflow using mern stack.
                i have also done a internship from oasis infobyte, this internship gives us challenging 
                opportunities and real time projects, it offers practical work 
                experience and an introduction to creating and improving web-based systems,
